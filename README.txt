# Wavetable Synthesis Project

## Description

This project generates a sine wave at 440 Hz (the standard A note) using wavetable synthesis. It utilizes NumPy for efficient computation and SciPy to save the generated audio to a `.wav` file. The generated audio file is a 3-second sine wave at 440 Hz.

## Current Status

- This project is still a work in progress.
- Currently, the focus is on implementing basic wavetable synthesis, and it can generate a simple sine wave.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy

#How to use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the Python script to generate a sine wave sound at 440 Hz. (Command: python wavetable_synth.py)
3. The script will generate a file named `sine440Hz.wav` in the same directory.
